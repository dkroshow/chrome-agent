A CLI tool that gives AI coding agents the ability to observe and interact with Chrome browsers via the [Chrome DevTools Protocol](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/).

Multiple agents and humans can share the same browser simultaneously, each with isolated event subscriptions. One agent drives while another observes network traffic. A human browses while an agent watches for errors. Four agents run a coordinated test suite against a single browser. Each participant sees only the events they subscribed to -- no interference.

## Why this exists

AI coding agents need to see and interact with browsers -- to test their code, debug automation, inspect page state. The standard approach (browser MCP tools) uses a persistent server with protocol negotiation and verbose response formatting. `chrome-agent` takes a different approach: direct access to Chrome's DevTools Protocol with no abstraction layer.

This means full CDP protocol access -- every command, every event, every domain Chrome exposes. Not a curated subset of capabilities, but the complete protocol. Agents compose interactions from CDP primitives the same way DevTools does.

## Tracks the running browser, not its own version

Because there is no abstraction layer, chrome-agent tracks your browser rather than its own release. The CLI sends the method name and parameters you give it straight to Chrome and streams back the events you subscribe to -- nothing is validated against a bundled schema. So **any command, event, or domain your installed Chrome supports just works**, including protocol surface added *after* the version of chrome-agent you installed. There is no curated subset to fall behind.

For example, the `CrashReportContext` and `WebMCP` domains (added to CDP in later Chrome releases) are both absent from an older chrome-agent's typed bindings, yet a method on one returns a normal result through the CLI, with no change to chrome-agent:

```bash
chrome-agent myproject-01 CrashReportContext.getEntries
# {"entries": []}
```

The one point-in-time artifact is the typed Python classes (see [Python API](#python-api)) -- an optional convenience layer that snapshots the schema at generation time. They never gate access: `CDPClient.send(method=..., params=...)` reaches any method regardless. And `help` reads the protocol schema live from the running browser, so its documentation is always as current as your Chrome.

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install chrome-agent
```

Or add to a project:

```bash
uv add chrome-agent
```

Requires Google Chrome or Chromium installed on the system. Single runtime dependency (`websockets`). No Playwright, no browser downloads.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Launch a browser -- auto-allocates a port and names the instance
chrome-agent launch
# {"name": "myproject-01", "port": 9222, "pid": 58469, "browser_version": "Chrome/147"}

# Check what's running
chrome-agent status
# myproject-01  port 9222
#   [1] 956FD3C2  https://example.com  "Example Domain"

# Read the page title
chrome-agent myproject-01 Runtime.evaluate '{"expression": "document.title", "returnByValue": true}'

# Navigate
chrome-agent myproject-01 Page.navigate '{"url": "https://example.com"}'

# Take a screenshot (returns base64 PNG in JSON)
chrome-agent myproject-01 Page.captureScreenshot '{"format": "png"}'

# Discover available commands
chrome-agent help myproject-01 Page
chrome-agent help myproject-01 Page.navigate

# Stop the browser when done
chrome-agent stop myproject-01

# Or stop a whole related set at once (quote the pattern -- see Instance Patterns)
chrome-agent stop 'myproject-*'
```

## Instance Patterns

Anywhere an instance name is accepted, a glob works instead -- `*`, `?`, `[abc]`, matched case-sensitively against the registered names.

```bash
chrome-agent stop 'myproject-*'      # stops every match, printing the names first
chrome-agent status 'myproject-*'    # lists every match
chrome-agent 'myproject-0[2]' Page.navigate '{"url": "https://example.com"}'
```

`stop` and `status` act on every match. The single-browser commands -- `attach`, `help` and one-shot CDP calls -- resolve a pattern that matches exactly one instance and otherwise error with the candidates listed, rather than picking one. A pattern matching nothing is an error, not a silent no-op.

**Quote the pattern.** Your shell expands an unquoted glob before chrome-agent sees it, and zsh aborts the command outright when nothing in the working directory matches (`zsh: no matches found: myproject-*`).

A literal name is never treated as a pattern, so `chrome-agent stop myproject-01` cannot sweep up `myproject-02`. Because `stop --target` closes one tab, combining it with a pattern that matches several instances is refused.

## Tab Completion

zsh only, for now. Two ways to install it; pick one.

**Sourced from `.zshrc`** -- one line, works anywhere, costs one subprocess
(~60 ms) at shell startup. It must come *after* `compinit`:

```bash
source <(chrome-agent completions zsh)
```

**Installed as a file** -- no startup cost, but the directory has to be on
`$fpath` *before* `compinit` runs, which is the step that is easy to miss:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/zsh/completions
chrome-agent completions zsh > ~/.config/zsh/completions/_chrome-agent
```

```bash
fpath=(~/.config/zsh/completions $fpath)
autoload -Uz compinit && compinit
```

That second block goes in `.zshrc`, in that order. If the directory is not on
`$fpath`, the file is simply never read and Tab does nothing -- there is no
error to tell you so.

Either way, open a new shell and check it took:

```bash
chrome-agent <TAB>
```

You should get the subcommands and your running instances, each with a
description. If nothing happens, `echo $_comps[chrome-agent]` should print
`_chrome-agent`; an empty result means the completion was never registered.

The generated file is a snapshot of the completion logic, so regenerate it after
upgrading chrome-agent (the *candidates* it offers are always read live; the
function itself is not). Sourcing from `.zshrc` avoids that entirely.

Completes the subcommands, their flags, the **live instance names**, and **CDP
method and event names**:

```
chrome-agent stop reader<TAB>              -> ensorcell-reader-01, described by port and tab count
chrome-agent taleb-01 Page.nav<TAB>        -> Page.navigate
chrome-agent attach taleb-01 +Page.load<TAB> -> +Page.loadEventFired
```

Instance names are read from the registry as you type, so they are what is
actually registered rather than a list baked in at install time. Methods and
events come from the running browser's own `/json/protocol` -- the protocol
*this* Chrome implements, not a snapshot shipped with chrome-agent -- cached on
disk under the browser version, so a Chrome upgrade invalidates it. Without a
running browser you simply get no candidates.

The protocol cache lives under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/chrome-agent` (default
`~/.cache/chrome-agent`), one file per browser version; deleting it is safe and
costs one 7 ms refetch.

## Two Channels

chrome-agent uses a two-channel pattern for browser interaction:

### One-shot mode (commands)

Send a single CDP command. Connects, sends, prints JSON response, disconnects.

```bash
chrome-agent <instance> Domain.method '{"param": "value"}'
```

Good for spot checks, screenshots, quick queries. ~50-80ms per call. If only one instance is running, the instance name can be omitted.

### Attach mode (events)

Persistent connection with isolated event subscriptions. Streams events to stdout as JSON lines.

```bash
chrome-agent attach <instance> +Page.loadEventFired +Network.requestWillBeSent
```

Run it in the background while sending one-shot commands:

```bash
# Background: observe events
chrome-agent attach myproject-01 +Page.loadEventFired +Network.requestWillBeSent > /tmp/events.jsonl &

# Foreground: send commands -- events appear in the attach stream
chrome-agent myproject-01 Page.navigate '{"url": "https://example.com"}'
```

Subscribe to exactly the events you need. Each attach session is isolated -- subscribing to Network events in one session does not affect other sessions.

An attach session **exits on its own once it has outlived its purpose** -- when its instance is retired from the registry, or its browser is gone or no longer reachable -- so a backgrounded observer never lingers indefinitely after the thing it was watching is gone. It also shuts down cleanly (detaching its CDP session) on `SIGTERM`/`SIGINT`, even while idle with no events arriving. A transient registry read or CDP-port blip is ridden out rather than acted on.

## Operational Commands

```
chrome-agent launch [--headless] [--fingerprint PATH] [--port PORT] [--no-window-border]
                    [--profile NAME | --profile-dir PATH]
chrome-agent profiles [list | path [NAME] | remove NAME --yes]
chrome-agent status [<instance|glob>]
chrome-agent attach <instance|glob> [+Event ...] [--target SPEC | --target-id ID | --target-index N | --url SUBSTRING]
chrome-agent stop <instance|glob> [--target SPEC | --target-id ID | --target-index N | --url SUBSTRING]
chrome-agent help [<instance|glob>] [Domain | Domain.method]
chrome-agent cleanup
chrome-agent completions <zsh | instances | methods | events> [<instance>]
chrome-agent --version
```

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `launch` | Find Chrome, launch with CDP enabled. Auto-allocates a port and names the instance from the current directory. |
| `profiles` | Manage persistent named profiles: `list` them, print a `path`, or `remove NAME --yes`. See [Persistent Profiles](#persistent-profiles). |
| `status` | List running instances with their page targets (IDs, URLs, titles). Accepts a glob to list a matching subset. |
| `attach` | Persistent event observation with isolated subscriptions. Use `--target` (fewer than 8 digits is a tab index, anything else a target-id prefix), `--url substring`, or the explicit `--target-id` / `--target-index` for multi-tab browsers. |
| `stop` | Gracefully shut down a browser instance (`Browser.close`) or close a specific tab (`Target.closeTarget`). Accepts a glob, stopping every matching instance. Use `--target` or `--url` to close a single tab without affecting the browser; because this closes a tab, prefer the explicit `--target-id` / `--target-index`. |
| `help` | Query the browser's protocol schema. Lists domains, commands, events, parameters. |
| `cleanup` | Remove stale instances (dead browsers) and their session directories. |
| `completions` | `zsh` prints a shell completion; `instances`, `methods` and `events` print `name:description` lines for the registered instances and for the running browser's CDP protocol (what the completion reads as you type). |
| `--version` | Print the installed chrome-agent version (`-V` alias) and exit. |

Instances are tracked in a registry at `/tmp/chrome-agent/registry.json`. A headed browser's instance is **automatically removed from the registry when its window is closed** (its session directory is cleaned up too), so `status` reflects what is actually running. Liveness is determined by **process identity plus port attribution**, not a bare PID-existence check: the recorded PID counts only if it is a live process of the launching user whose start time matches what was recorded at launch (so a recycled or namespace-local PID never masquerades as the browser), and a listening CDP port counts only if a process claiming that port with this instance's profile directory can be found -- so browsers started via wrapper/snap launchers (which fork the real browser into another process) are still reported correctly, while a port since claimed by a *different* browser is not mistaken for this one. A **transient connection drop does not retire a live instance**: a host suspend/resume severs the supervisor's CDP connection while Chrome keeps running, so the supervisor reconnects and keeps supervising; retirement happens only once the CDP port stops listening. `cleanup` removes any entries that remain (headless instances, or browsers that were killed abruptly).

Two consequences worth knowing. **Launching from inside a PID-namespaced sandbox** (a container, bubblewrap, some agent-CLI sandboxes) records the sandbox's local PID in the shared registry; the identity check recognizes such an entry as stale once its browser is gone, instead of treating the aliased host PID as a live browser forever. **`stop` verifies its target before acting**: it never sends `Browser.close` to a port that is serving a different browser (it terminates the instance's own verified process instead, or just cleans up the stale entry), and its SIGTERM fallback only ever fires at a PID verified to be the instance's own browser process.

## Persistent Profiles

By default every launch gets a throwaway Chrome profile that is deleted when the browser stops, so every launch starts logged out. A **persistent profile** keeps website sessions and installed extensions across stop, window close, crash and `cleanup`.

```bash
chrome-agent launch --profile work          # created on first use; reused afterwards
# ... sign in to a site once, in the window ...
chrome-agent stop myproject-01              # the profile stays
chrome-agent launch --profile work          # still signed in

chrome-agent profiles list
chrome-agent profiles path work             # where it lives
chrome-agent profiles remove work --yes     # the only command that deletes a profile
```

- **`--profile NAME`** uses a profile chrome-agent manages under a per-user directory (owner-only, mode `0700`, on macOS and Linux; `~/Library/Application Support/chrome-agent/profiles` on macOS, `$XDG_DATA_HOME/chrome-agent/profiles` on Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\chrome-agent\profiles` on Windows; override with `CHROME_AGENT_PROFILE_ROOT`). Names are lowercase letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`. Use one profile per account context: sites that share a sign-in can share a profile; accounts that must not mix get separate profiles.
- **`--profile-dir PATH`** uses a directory you own, anywhere. chrome-agent never deletes it -- not on `stop`, not on `cleanup`, and `profiles remove` does not apply to it. Refused: a symlink, another user's directory, your everyday Chrome profile, and anything under `/tmp/chrome-agent`.
- **One browser per profile.** Launching a profile that is already running returns that instance (`"reused": true` in the JSON output) instead of starting a second browser. If a browser chrome-agent does not manage holds the profile, the launch is refused. `status` shows each instance's `profile` / `profile_dir`, so callers can select a browser by profile rather than by position.
- **`profiles remove`** requires `--yes`, and refuses while any browser is using the profile. It is **not supported on Windows**, where chrome-agent cannot verify that a profile is idle; delete the directory yourself there.
- A raw `-- --user-data-dir=...` cannot be combined with either option: Chrome honours the last one it is given, which would silently move the browser off the profile chrome-agent records and protects.

**macOS: launch from the desktop session.** Chrome encrypts cookies with a key in the login keychain, which a process started over SSH (or from some daemons) may not be able to use. A persistent profile opened that way can come up signed out, and its saved logins are at risk, so chrome-agent refuses unless `launchctl managername` reports exactly `Aqua` (it also refuses when that cannot be determined). Terminal, desktop apps and LaunchAgents run in the desktop session. `CHROME_AGENT_ALLOW_NO_GUI_SESSION=1` overrides the refusal.

**What it does and does not promise.** Persistence stops chrome-agent from destroying a session; the website still decides how long that session lasts, and can expire or revoke it. After a crash, only state Chrome had already written to disk survives. chrome-agent writes nothing into a persistent profile (no seeded preferences, no `--password-store=basic`) and never reads or exports its authentication or browsing data; the only thing it reads there is the target of Chrome's `SingletonLock` (a host name and PID), to tell whether a browser is using the profile. A profile is not portable between machines.

**Platform support.** Exercised on macOS. The Linux code paths follow the same POSIX model but have not been exercised. On Windows the guarantees are weaker: directory permissions and ownership are left to the platform's ACLs (no owner-only mode, no foreign-owner refusal), there is no launch lock or registry lock (`flock` is unavailable, so only Chrome's own profile lock guards a double launch, and concurrent launches can lose a registry update), a profile held by an unmanaged browser is not detected, and `profiles remove` is refused.

## Interacting with Elements

Agents interact with page elements using a three-step pattern: **locate, act, verify.**

```bash
# Locate -- find element coordinates via JavaScript
chrome-agent myproject-01 Runtime.evaluate '{"expression": "(() => { const r = document.querySelector(\"#submit\").getBoundingClientRect(); return {x: r.x+r.width/2, y: r.y+r.height/2}; })()", "returnByValue": true}'

# Act -- dispatch real input events at those coordinates
chrome-agent myproject-01 Input.dispatchMouseEvent '{"type": "mousePressed", "x": 400, "y": 300, "button": "left", "clickCount": 1}'
chrome-agent myproject-01 Input.dispatchMouseEvent '{"type": "mouseReleased", "x": 400, "y": 300, "button": "left", "clickCount": 1}'

# Verify -- confirm the action worked
chrome-agent myproject-01 Runtime.evaluate '{"expression": "document.title", "returnByValue": true}'
```

Chrome processes dispatched input events identically to physical input. A human watching the browser sees the cursor move, buttons depress, text highlight, and pages load in real time.

## Python API

```python
from chrome_agent.cdp_client import CDPClient, get_ws_url
from chrome_agent.domains.page import Page
from chrome_agent.domains.runtime import Runtime

async with CDPClient(ws_url=get_ws_url(port=9222)) as cdp:
    page = Page(client=cdp)
    runtime = Runtime(client=cdp)

    await page.navigate(url="https://example.com")
    result = await runtime.evaluate(expression="document.title", return_by_value=True)
    print(result["result"]["value"])
```

54 typed domain classes with snake_case methods, generated from Chrome's protocol schema. They are an optional convenience layer -- a point-in-time snapshot, not a gate. For any method newer than the snapshot, call `CDPClient.send(method=..., params=...)` directly (see [Tracks the running browser, not its own version](#tracks-the-running-browser-not-its-own-version)).

## Window Border

So you can tell an agent-driven window apart from your own Chrome windows, every launched browser is marked by default: a colored border + corner badge around each tab (a stable, per-instance color derived from the instance name), and a title prefix so the window reads as `🤖 <instance> — <the page's own title>` in the taskbar / Alt-Tab. The marker is drawn in a closed shadow DOM and adds no automation-detection signal (verified against bot.sannysoft.com and CreepJS).

```bash
chrome-agent launch                     # marked (default)
chrome-agent launch --no-window-border  # no marker
```

The marker is suppressed automatically when running `--headless` (no visible window) or with `--fingerprint` (the in-page marker is page-observable, and stealth is the point on the sites where fingerprinting is used).

## Browser Fingerprinting

For sites that detect automated browsers, launch with a fingerprint profile:

```bash
chrome-agent launch --fingerprint profile.json
```

```json
{
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 ...",
    "platform": "Linux x86_64",
    "vendor": "Google Inc.",
    "language": "en-US",
    "timezone": "America/Chicago",
    "viewport": {"width": 1920, "height": 1080}
}
```

Spoofs the user agent (HTTP header and JavaScript), viewport, language, and timezone via Chrome launch flags -- persistent across navigations, with no JavaScript injection.

It deliberately does **not** patch `navigator.webdriver`, `navigator.platform`, `navigator.vendor`, or `window.chrome`. An empirical detection audit found those JS overrides are each independently detectable and make the browser *more* detectable, not less: they flip bot.sannysoft.com's WebDriver test from pass to fail (the override makes `navigator.webdriver` an own property) and raise CreepJS's headless score. A plain CDP-attached Chrome already reports the native `navigator.webdriver === false` and keeps the genuine `window.chrome` shape, so the cleanest profile is one that leaves the JS environment untouched. A profile's `platform`/`vendor` should match the host OS (they are retained in the schema but not spoofed). Note that WebRTC can still leak the real IP regardless of profile.

## For AI Agents

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for concise agent instructions (the standard for AI agent tool documentation). It covers the mental model (address an instance, send any CDP command), the sense ⇄ act loop, the two channels, the command reference, and gotchas.

**The guide ships with the package**, so an agent can reach it from any install without a checkout:

```bash
chrome-agent guide          # print the guide
chrome-agent guide --path   # print its path, to read with your own file tools
```

`--path` is usually what you want: reading the file directly beats paging 20+ KB through stdout. The command is listed in `chrome-agent --help`, which is how an agent meeting this tool for the first time finds it.

The bundled copy is captured when the release is built, so it always matches the version installed. To make it load automatically -- most agent harnesses read an `AGENTS.md` from the *project* root, not from site-packages -- link it into your project:

```bash
ln -s "$(chrome-agent guide --path)" AGENTS-chrome-agent.md
```

**`AGENTS.md` is a tailorable example, not gospel.** Its *mechanics* are exact, but the operating judgment in it is general -- adapt it to your own sites, tasks, and constraints. A good pattern is to keep a private, project-specific layer on top -- site-specific field notes, extraction playbooks, hard-won gotchas -- that *references* this public manual and extends it, rather than forking a separate set of instructions. Grow yours the same way.

## Collaboration

Multiple participants -- humans, AI agents, or both -- can share a browser simultaneously. Each participant creates an independent CDP session with isolated event subscriptions. One agent enabling Network observation does not flood another agent's event stream.

See [docs/collaboration-guide.md](docs/collaboration-guide.md) for:
- Human-agent collaboration patterns (you browse, agent watches)
- Agent-driven workflows (agent drives, you supervise)
- Multi-agent setups with isolated event subscriptions
- The observation gap (what CDP sees vs what it misses)
- Full interaction observation via the binding bridge

For real-time observation using Claude Code's Monitor tool, see [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#reacting-to-events-as-they-happen-monitor) for the practical usage path (subscribing, discovering events via `help`, the gotchas), and [docs/monitor-integration.md](docs/monitor-integration.md) for the architecture and usage patterns in depth.

Monitor is specific to Claude Code. Agents on other harnesses can still be event-driven rather than falling back to fixed sleeps -- background `attach` to a file once, then block on [`scripts/cdp-wait.py`](scripts/cdp-wait.py), which returns the instant a matching event lands and also catches events that fired before the wait began. See [docs/event-driven-without-monitor.md](docs/event-driven-without-monitor.md).

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.11
- Google Chrome or Chromium (system-installed)
- Linux with xdotool (optional, for virtual desktop pinning)

## Releasing (maintainer)

Releases are cut from the project root with `release X.Y.Z` (or `release` for an interactive version prompt). The tool bumps `pyproject.toml`, commits, tags, pushes -- which triggers the PyPI publish workflow via GitHub Actions Trusted Publishing. Release notes auto-generate from commit messages between tags, so commits should read well as changelog entries.
